# Sales_Analysis_Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Sales Analysis Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI to analyze business performance across multiple dimensions including sales, profit, customers, categories, geography, and time.

The dashboard provides key insights through dynamic KPIs such as Total Sales, Total Profit, and Customer Count, along with visual analytics like sales by state map, monthly sales trends, category-wise performance, yearly profit comparison, and customer distribution analysis.

It supports interactive filtering using slicers for Year, Month, and Category, enabling users to explore data from multiple perspectives and perform drill-down analysis.
This project demonstrates practical implementation of DAX measures, data modeling, time intelligence, geo-visualization, and business intelligence best practices for real-world analytics use cases.
